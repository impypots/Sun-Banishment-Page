                    <h3>Inhumane Status Quo</h3>
                    <a id="backcolor1">In today’s society, the ways in which we handle those who deserve the greatest punishment is cruel, barbaric, and most of all, inhumane. No society can say that it truly loves justice while treating even the worst of its citizens in this manner.</a>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Mission</h3>
                    <a id="backcolor2">The Sun Banishment movement is about real-world change, simple as that. We want legislative action, not empty platitudes. Our ultimate goal is to make our government discontinue the use of execution, in favor of replacing it with the more humane* approach of shooting death row inmates directly into the Sun.</a>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
                    <a id="backcolor3">The current system of execution is ethically reprehensible and beyond that, inaccurate. According to a study led by the law professor Samuel Gross, at least 4% of those on death row were wrongfully convicted. More importantly, Shemesh, our Great Mother, demands sacrifice and must be fed. FEED HER FEED HER FEED HER.</a>

            <div class="saying2">How It Works</div>
            <div id="process">
                <p>Firstly, it is important to note that the recipients of this new solution are patients, not inmates. The heart of this process is reconciliatory, not draconian. Every patient is provided free therapy sessions preceding their journey, in order to help them come to terms with the new direction their life is taking (directly into the Sun).</p>

                <img id="backImg2" src="C:\Projects\Sun Banishment Activism\Images\vessel.png">
                <p>The vessel is equipped with an automated sound system that plays relaxing music to settle the patient. It also has a blanket (secondhand), enough food and water to last the entire trip, and a calming poster that reads “DON’T PANIC” in a welcoming bright red.</p>
                <p>The day the patient reaches the local area of our Sun is called the Day of Forgiveness because on this day every patient is pardoned for any and all crimes committed. If they can somehow escape the gravitational pull of the Bringer of Life and make it back to earth, they will be welcomed back as free citizens.</p>
